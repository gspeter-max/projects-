Meta-Learning for Cold Start Problem in YouTube Recommender System
YouTube has a massive user base with diverse video preferences. To provide accurate video recommendations, YouTube uses a recommender system that relies on user-video interaction data. However, when a new user signs up, the system faces the cold start problem: it lacks information about the user's preferences and cannot provide accurate recommendations.
To address this issue, you decide to use a meta-learning approach. Your goal is to train a meta-model that can learn to adapt to new users and provide accurate recommendations even when there is limited information available.


Dataset:
                    You have access to a massive dataset of user-video interactions, which is highly imbalanced:
                    1% of users account for 90% of interactions
                    50% of users account for only 1% of interactions
                    The dataset contains the following features:
                    User ID
                    Video ID
                    Interaction type (e.g., watch, like, dislike)
                    Timestamp


Task:
        Design and train a meta-model that can:
        Learn to adapt to new users with limited interaction data
        Provide accurate video recommendations for new users
        Handle the highly imbalanced dataset and prevent overfitting
        Evaluation Metrics:
        Recommendation accuracy (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score)
        Adaptation speed (e.g., how quickly the model adapts to new users)
        Robustness to imbalance (e.g., how well the model handles the imbalanced dataset)
        What's Your Approach?
        Please provide a detailed description of your approach, including:
        Meta-model architecture
        Training procedure
        Handling of imbalanced dataset
        Evaluation metrics and expected results
